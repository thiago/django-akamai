"""Interact with the Akamai CCU API

`PurgeRequest` is a simple wrapper around the CCU REST API[1]_ using the
requests[2]_ library.

Example usage::

>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> from django_akamai.purge import PurgeRequest
>>> pr = PurgeRequest()
>>> pr.add("http://www.example.com/url-1.html")
>>> pr.add(u"http://www.example.com/url-2.html")
>>> pr.purge_all()
>>> pr.add(large_collection_of_urls)
>>> for url_batch, response in pr.purge(): print(response.status_code)
201
201
201
507

URLs can also be passed in when initially creating `PurgeRequest` and will be
passed to `PurgeRequest.add()` verbatim.

In addition to the single URLs shown in the example above `PurgeRequest.add()`
accepts lists or tuples of URLs as well as Django Model and QuerySet instances
which implement `get_absolute_url()`.

For general usage, `purge_all()` is recommended but `purge()` allows you to
receive more information while requests are pending and possibly implement your
own

Result codes follow this pattern from the CCU API docs:
201 - The removal request has been accepted.
4xx - Invalid request
507 - API rate-limit – try again later
5xx - Contact Akamai support

API responses should be JSON objects containing a `detail` element with
additional information.
